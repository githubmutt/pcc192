Do the following:

Save code1-1_txt.html as code1-1.html. Open the file *code1-1.html* and in the comment section enter your **name** (First + Last) and the **date** (MM/DD/YYYY) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields of the file.
   
Within the ```body``` section of the file, enter the text **Government Sites on the Web**. Mark that text as an ```h1``` heading.
        
Place the list of government websites within an unordered list nested within a navigation list. Mark each government website as a separate list item.

Mark the text of each government site as a hypertext link using the ```<a>``` tag. Set the ```href``` attribute to the URLs specified above.

Verify the final website looks as designed.
